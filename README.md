# kaggle_competitions

This repository is dedicated to hosting a collection of Jupyter notebooks developed for participation in Kaggle competitions. Each notebook contains the exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation processes undertaken during the competition. The goal is to share insights, methodologies, and solutions that can serve as a reference or starting point for future participants or anyone interested in machine learning and data science challenges.
